title: Storage Provider Quickstart
---

🎉 Spade v0 - Pilot Phase allows select Storage Providers to onboard!

Spade is designed as a deal-discovery and deal-making tool that is optimized for Storage Providers (SPs) to receive Fil+ denominated storage deals. It does this by aggregating storage requests and metadata from various sources (Spade tenants) and then presenting the aggregate as a single machine and human readable stream. Participating SPs consume this aggregate and can trigger storage deal proposals for any entry, as long as the proposal does not violate the terms set by the originating tenant.

Spade is designed exclusively around a "pull" workflow. A deal proposal can only be initiated by the receiving SP and all deal proposals are, without exception, made for out-of-band data flow (often mislabeled *offline deals*). This gives complete control to the SP operator over both the deal-transfer mechanism, and the timing of data injection into their carefully tuned sealing pipeline.

## SP sign up

### Spade requirements

For each SP ID you own/operate to which you want to request deal proposals from Spade:

1. your PeerID must have a multiaddress announced to the chain
2. you have to disclose location (currently defined by tenants in Pilot as metro area / city)

### Tenant-specific requirements

Tenants that wish to store data on Filecoin using Spade may request additional checks. These can include the size of your SP ID on chain (measured in RBP or QAP), ensuring you are able to service free and fast retrievals, that you are announcing deals to the network indexer, that you are running booster bitswap, etc.

Please note that you only need to meet the requirements of the tenants for which you’d like to receive deal proposals for, not a superset of requirements posed by tenants. Spade will continue to ask tenants to be as specific as possible with regards to information requested, as well as disclose how that information will be used. For every tenant, the policy will also be published and we will ask you to review and ACK it before making any deals with that tenant.

As the set of tenants grows on Spade, we will work to improve the UX for both tenants and SPs to make this process more seamless while remaining transparent.

**Before you begin, please check:**

1. Your MinerID has at least 10 TiB of Quality Adjusted Power on chain
    1. If your miner is new and does not have this much QAP, the easiest way to meet this requirement is to seal CC sectors
2. Your PeerID has a multiaddress announced to the chain
3. Your miner is at least 30 days old, unless it’s a new miner from an existing SP organization that has existed for more than 30 days

## SP authentication

You will be continuously asked to validate that you are the current operator of a particular SP system. Authentication is based on having access to your SP Worker Key (the same one you use to submit ProveCommits when onboarding new sectors).

You can either use the reference authenticator script, or write your own [based on the simple steps described within](https://github.com/ribasushi/bash-fil-spid-v0/blob/5f41eec1a/fil-spid.bash#L13-L33).

1. Download the authenticator: `curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ribasushi/bash-fil-spid-v0/5f41eec1a/fil-spid.bash`
2. Make it executable `chmod 755 fil-spid.bash`
3. Use it as part of your requests, e.g: `curl -sLH "Authorization: $( ./fil-spid.bash f0XXXX )" https://api.spade.storage/sp/eligible_pieces`

## Making deals with Spade’s broker API

Spade consists of several components - SPs will interact with the broker API to receive the aggregate list of CIDs they can store and request corresponding deal proposals.

Here’s a set of steps you need to take as an SP to ping the broker API and receive the list of potential deal proposals:

1. Run the updated fil-spid.bash: `curl -sLH "Authorization: $( ./fil-spid.bash f0xxxxx )" https://api.spade.storage/sp/eligible_pieces`
2. To request deal proposals, use the `sample_reserve_cmd` from that and adjust as needed
3. Once you have requested a deal proposal, to get the actual piece to seal the deal, use `curl -sLH "Authorization: $( ./fil-spid.bash f0xxxxx )" https://api.spade.storage/sp/pending_proposals`. It will return an array with `https` URLs for the data you need to download for your pending proposals

Once you get the data, seal the deal!

## Current tenants

During the Spade v0 - Pilot Phase, we are opening up to a limited set of tenants.

As of September 2023, Spade Pilot is open for:

1. Internet Archive
2. DAG House (web3.storage, nft.storage)

### Making deals with Internet Archive

**Register for deal making with Internet Archive:**

1. Navigate to the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfoOs5GTTdl8-8Wc65J-J8ArzCP7HYPPcAVlbbEO9-mAM5mQ/viewform)
2. Enter relevant information, including your name, email, miner ID, its location, etc.
    1. if you have multiple minerIDs, please be sure to enter them separately by clicking “Yes” to “Do you have another minerID to register?”
    2. make sure that the location is entered correctly for each miner, as failing to do so would result in failing the location check in place
3. Agree to the terms and conditions on how IA/PL using this sign up flow might use your data
4. Submit the form to initiate the lightweight-KYC check
5. Allow 3 business days for the KYC process to complete
6. If your miner isn’t set up after 3 business days, ping us on #spade-sp in Filecoin Slack

### Making deals with DAG House

Note: DAG House currently uses the default Slingshot registration flow. This flow will continue to be adjusted and formalized as part of our Project Ground Control.
