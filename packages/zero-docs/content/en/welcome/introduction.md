We read docs. A lot. We know a great many docs sites inside and out. Each has features that make it stand out and make the docs experience drastically better, but usually we're left a little wanting. We decided to pull together all the features we found the most useful and put them all into a single docs experience. With careful attention to website layout and typography as well as repo structure, we've come to a pretty happy point. Here's what we have:

- Markdown-driven documentation
- An [API Preview](/api-sample/introduction) component
- An [API Overview](/api-sample/introduction) component
- Add real, live interactive Vue components to display your work
- A layout and typography that don't make your eyes hurt
- A magellan nav
- Pagination
- Algolia indexing & search
- Multi-language support
- Full SEO support, including schema.org
- Static site generation
- Dark & light mode support
- Easy to customize
- Written in Nuxt 3 ðŸ’ª

You can see an example of some of these features in action in the following sections:

- [Simple markdown](/content-sample/simple-markdown)
- [Preview a component](/content-sample/preview-a-component)
- [API Preview & Overview](/api-sample/introduction)
