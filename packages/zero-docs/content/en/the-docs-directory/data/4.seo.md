### SEO

`seo.json` is used to define global and page-specific SEO structures. Here is what a base SEO definition looks like:

```json
{
  "_": {
    "title": "Docs Starter",
    "description": "Get a docs site up and running fast ðŸš€",
    "siteName": "Docs Starter",
    "ogImage": "/public/open-graph.jpg"
  },
  "*": {
    "title": "Docs Starter - |title|",
    "description": "|description|"
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "Docs Starter - |title|",
    "description": "|description|",
    "ogImage": "/public/open-graph-specific-to-about-page.jpg"
  }
}
```

**`_`** | `required`

This object defines the default, site-wide SEO. It is also the final fallback if more page-specific SEO information cannot be found.

**`*`**

This object defines the page-specific SEO. Since this template only has 1 page (a catch-all), we only need to define our page-specific SEO here.

ðŸ’¡ all keys except for `_` can be named in any way, `*` is not a reserved keyname, it could easily be `catch-all` or `general`, for example.

#### Frontmatter

The keys in `seo.json` can contain text that can be replaced by frontmatter-defined values. This is achieved by wrapping the keys that are to be matched in pipes. For example, considering the following SEO object:

```json
"*": {
  "title": "Docs Starter - |title|",
  "description": "|description|"
}
```

and the following frontmatter inside an content markdown file:

```markdown
---
title: Introduction
description: Write docs like a pro ðŸ’ª
---
```

The keys wrapped in pipes in the SEO JSON object will be replaced by the keys defined in the frontmatter to produce the following SEO output:

```json
{
  "title": "Docs Starter - Introduction",
  "description": "Write docs like a pro ðŸ’ª"
}
```

Any keys included in blocks that are not the default (`_`) will replace the default value.

```json
{
  "_": {
    "title": "Docs Starter",
    "description": "Get a docs site up and running fast ðŸš€",
    "siteName": "Docs Starter",
    "ogImage": "/public/open-graph.jpg"
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "Docs Starter - |title|",
    "description": "|description|",
    "ogImage": "/public/open-graph-specific-to-about-page.jpg"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the `ogImage` URL defined in the `about` block will override the default that's defined in the `_` block.
