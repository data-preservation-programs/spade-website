### Configuration

Some configuration is required and can be performed in the `nuxt.config.js` file. Here is the default Algolia configuration block:

```js
algolia: {
  disable: false, // default: false
  apiKey: process.env.ALGOLIA_API_KEY,
  applicationId: process.env.ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID,
  indexName: `${process.env.ALGOLIA_INDEX_ID}__${env}`,
  contentDirectoryName: 'content' // default: 'content'
}
```

All keys are kept in the root `.env` file, it's best to keep them there rather than hardcoding them into the configuration block as strings and committing them to your docs repo.

Since this repo supports different development enviroments through the `SERVER_ENV` environment variable (seen as the `env` vairable in the configuration block above), the `indexName` is suffixed to differentiate environments. You could do something like this:

**.env**
```
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=12345
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=678910
ALGOLIA_INDEX_ID=my-fancy-docs-site
```

This will result in the following output in the Nuxt config:

```js
algolia: {
  apiKey: '12345',
  applicationId: '678910',
  indexName: 'my-fancy-docs-site__development' // or __staging, __production, etc.
}
```

As well, Algolia can be disabled by setting `disable: true` in the configuration block

```js
algolia: {
  disable: true,
  ...
}
```

❗️ The `contentDirectoryName` key is very important. If the content directory name is every changed from `docs/content` to `docs/*`, make sure to update this key to the new directory name. The default is `content`.
