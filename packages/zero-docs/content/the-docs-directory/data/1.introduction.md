### Directory setup

In the top-level `docs` directory, create a `docs/data` subdirectory. The name is strict. Once created the `@nuxt/content` module will load all the appropriate files and the dev server will watch this directory for changes and auto-restart when they are detected. The following filetypes are supported: `.json` and `.js`. The files required to be placed in this directory are specific and strict, the include the following:

- `sidebar.json` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/sidebar.json))
- `settings.json` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/settings.json))
- `seo.json` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/seo.json))
- `navigation.json` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/navigation.json))
- `footer.json` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/footer.json))
- `nuxt.config.js` ([example](https://github.com/undone-labs/docs-starter/blob/main/packages/src/docs-base/data/nuxt.config.js))

It is recommended to copy the files found in `src/docs-base/data` to `docs/data` and modify them to fit the needs of your site.
