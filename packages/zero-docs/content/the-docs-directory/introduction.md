The top-level `docs` directory is where everything goes, from content to theming. It follows the same structure as the `src/docs-base` directory and attempts to make working with content and styling as simple as possible. The development server watches this directory for changes. Modification of existing files (or the addition of new ones) automatically restarts the dev server.
